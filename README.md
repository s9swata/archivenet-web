# archiveNet

**archiveNet** is a decentralized memory management protocol for AI agents, built on top of [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/). It enables agents to persist, retrieve, and interact with long-term memories in a trustless, permanent, and censorship-resistant manner.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📦 **Permanent Memory**: Powered by Arweave's permaweb, ensuring that memory stored is immutable and forever retrievable.
- 🔐 **Decentralized & Trustless**: No centralized server or authority—data ownership and access is verifiable and cryptographically secure.
- 🧠 **Agent-Native Interface**: Tailored APIs for seamless integration with AI agents and autonomous systems.
- ⚙️ **Composable Protocol**: Designed to be modular—plug in your own memory indexers, retrievers, or access control layers.

---

## 📦 Use Cases

- Personal AI assistants with long-term memory
- Memory syncing across multiple agents
- Decentralized knowledge graphs
- Persistent context history for autonomous agents
- Research logging and reproducibility
